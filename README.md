## Project Description
**Distributed Optimization:** In this project, Distributed optimization algorithms are implemented and evaluated on synthetic functions. 
As the goal of this project is to have a clear software, good documentations, commits, and test files are provided. 

## Project Structure
* **Files:** 
   * **Algorithms.py:** Algorithms that are used in this project to minimize a separable sum cost function in a distributed manner over directed random or exponential graphs. 
   * **graph.py:** Two classes of graphs, Random and Exponetial, are defined in this file, each of divided into directed or undirected graphs. 
   * *problem.py:* Describe the problem at hand. The methods in this file compute the objective value and gradient of the cost functions, plus the projection onto convex linear sets.
   * **utilities.py:** Extra functions that are used in the project.
   * **analysis.py:** Contain the definitions of metrics that are used to evaluate the algorithms.
   * **main.py:** The main code of the project that produce the results. 
   * **Test files** We use unittest library to write unittest functions. 
* **Launch:** 
   * **Run main.py file**
   * **See the results in plots**
   * **If you decide to change the definitions of functions, run test functions**
